InfoSequia – Public User Manual

BACKGROUND
==========

Executive summary 
-----------------

InfoSequia is an operational expert-analysis climate service with enhanced drought monitoring and seasonal forecasting capabilities by combining EO-climate data, and cloud geoprocessing client-tailored and machine learning techniques.

It was designed as a Drought Early Warning System (DEWS) to support disaster risk management at the basin and agricultural district levels. InfoSequia provides timely and contextualized data in the form of: 1) warnings of ongoing drought hazard (severity and spatial extension) and, 2) impact-based seasonal forecasts for crop yield and water supply. Data generated by InfoSequia can be accessed through multiple channels, i.e.: a) FTP or API-authentication protocol/channel, or b) a user-friendly web mapping interface. Also, outcomes can be easily ingested in PaaS/SaaS solutions already available in the market.

InfoSequia is characterized by its modularity and robustness, its flexibility and the quality of its outcomes (e.g. data with enhanced spatial and temporal resolutions, short revisit times). The operational service is very suitable for being coupled with other monitoring or forecasting technologies, or helping different market segments by addressing their needs, including:

- more efficient and transparent management of droughts, by enabling the early generation of warnings and alerts and the justification of preventive actions. This would mean in time and cost savings by simplifying and systematization reporting commitments or avoiding the onset of severe impacts on the population (useful for water management authorities, and disaster response and management agencies)

- adjustment of irrigation quotas and restrictions at the district or province level (agricultural sector – irrigation boards and extension officers).

- early detection of scheme failures (e.g. crop yield damages and water shortage events) which allows a more accurate planning of financial and insurance needs, and to optimize the allocation of human resources for field-based inspections (insurance/re-insurance).

- triggering of ex-ante cash transfer and voucher programmes (civil defence and response organizations)

Fit-for purpose 
---------------

Droughts and water stress are complex risks affecting millions of people and contributing to food insecurity, poverty and inequality (UNDRR, 2021). Economic losses in the last century have been estimated in >250 billion US$, and almost 700k deaths were reported in Africa in this period (WMO, 2021). Climate change will exacerbate the recurrence and severity of drought and water stress events.

Around 11 water stress hotspots have been detected worldwide, 4 of which are located in Africa.

Despite its proven usefulness and effectiveness as key tools for drought management and adaptation, the use of DEWSs and the inclusion of satellite data into them is being hampered by the existence of technological, and institutional and social barriers. According to a recent WMO’s report (WMO, 2021), around 60% of its country members lack the full capacity needed to provide climate services for water, being specially acute for those services centered in monitoring and forecasting droughts and their potential impacts.

Technological barriers make difficult to reach enough specificity and reliability to map and early detect local patterns of drought hazard and risk. Sometimes these barriers, which inhibit the development of more local-oriented and user-tailored DEWS, are related with the lack of: 1) -computing- capabilities to deal with increasingly demanding needs of higher spatial resolutions, temporal updating frequencies, or accuracy and reliability metrics, 2) ground observations of drought impact required to validate EO- and model-based indicators, or to train and test forecasting models, or 3) specific standards for the development, maintenance and qualification of climate services is also.

Key PE

Institutional and social barriers rest on the not enough trustiness on DEWS due to: 1) lack of understandable and transparent indicators of warning/alert, or difficulty to reach those indicators through intuitive and interactive platforms able to simplify the access, sharing and communication of relevant data, 2) the permanent feeling of being in a permanent status of alert which strongly reduce the trustreliability of the forecast.

InfoSequia aims to break down these barriers and fit the needs by:

- Adopting a cloud processing architecture and the most advanced computing and modelling techniques.

- Providing a new suite of meteorological drought indices, including Precipitation percentiles, Standardized Precipitation Index (considered by the World Meteorological Organization as the reference drought index), and the Standardized Precipitation-Evaporation Index (best suited for drylands)

- Providing a suite of singular and blended vegetation health indices derived from NASA and ESA missions

- Assimilating agrometeorological ground observations retrieved from local and national networks for calibration and verification purposes.

- Quantifying the severity and persistence of drought hazard by adopting short (1, 3 month) and long-term (6, 12 months) timescales.

- Improving the spatial and temporal resolution traits for InfoSequia products (dekad-based TR, and from 5 km to 100 m. of SR depending on user needs)

- Sharing or integrating InfoSequia outcomes through user-friendly front-end platforms or standard communication channels.

Value proposition 
-----------------

-  Timely and regular monitoring of drought status and intensity through generation of multi-source and multi-sensor products

-  Seasonal outlooks of crop yield and water supply failures, plus performance and uncertainty metrics to support making decision (under development)

-  Flexibility, modularity, and user/site-tailored designed according to customer needs and requirements

-  Front-end webmapping, data query from API, integration in SaaS/PaaS solutions (data centers)

Long-term solution (with regular maintenance and upgrades + technical support)

InfoSequia-4CAST aims to meet the needs of water management authorities and humanitarian-aid agencies by providing actionable, seasonal-scale outlooks of drought-induced crop yield and water supply failures, with the required level of accuracy, reliability, and location-specificity.

Water and food security are at risk in many places around the world, at present and even more so in the future, with significant economic and humanitarian consequences. Risk managers and decision-makers (e.g. water management authorities and humanitarian-aid agencies) can more effectively prevent harmful drought impacts if timely information is available on how the system is affected, and the probability of a system failure.

InfoSequia-4CAST combines historical and up-to-date observations of satellite-based meteorological and agricultural drought indices with climate variability indices, to generate seasonal outlooks of water supply and crop yield failure alerts. These impact-based indicators are computed using a simple, robust and easily understandable statistical forecasting-modelling framework. By making use of multi-sensor, state-of-the art satellite data fully integrated with predictive models, InfoSequia-4CAST provides locally-specific, 3-6 month outlooks and warnings of crop yield and water supply failures to end users through a simple, intuitive user interface.

The product is tailored to the needs of water managers who are looking to alleviate and mitigate impacts of forthcoming drought periods by taking strategic water management decisions, and humanitarian NGOs aiming to trigger ex-ante cash transfers with policyholders and farmer communities.

Key Performance Indicators
--------------------------

The quality of the seasonal forecasts of InfoSequia is evaluated according its capability to address the needs and technical gaps identified by users. Definition and quantification of these needs are continuously evaluated through specific surveys and/or regular meetings with target user segments, including river basin authorities and humanitarian NGO’s. These needs are translated into several target KPIs and metrics which refer to aspects as geographical scale, forecasting lead time(s), update frequency, latency, reliability and access to the system outcomes (Table 2).
